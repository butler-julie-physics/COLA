# Jupyter Books: An Easy to Use Software for Creating Digital Textbooks

## What are Jupyter Books?
Jupyter Book is a software which is used create digital books, released by the company Jupyter.  Jupyter is also the creator of Jupyter Notebooks, a popular software for running Python code that allows for text blocks to be interspersed with code blocks.  A tutorial for how to use Jupyter Books is beyond the scope of this project, but the [Jupyter Books website](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) has an excellent guide for getting started.

## Why Jupyter Books Make Good Digital Textbooks
Because Jupyter Books creates a digital book, it makes it an natural choice for use in creating digital textbooks.  Additionally, becuase it supports integration with Jupyter Notebooks code, mathematical equations, videos, and interactive Python widgets can easily be included, making Jupyter Books an ideal choice for creating digital textbooks for STEM classes.  Listed below are some benefits of using Jupyter Books to create digital textbooks, along with some possible problems that could occur.   

#### Benefits of Using Jupyter Books for Digital Textbooks
* All software needed for Jupyter Books is open-source, so it is avaliable at no cost to the user.
* Jupyter Books are searchable and have side bars to show the table of contents for the entire book (left side of the screen) and for the current page (right side of the screen).
* The pages in a Jupyter Book can either be Mardown text files or Jupyter notebooks, meaning that pre-existing course content in these forms can be easily included.
* Jupyter Books are customizable and can contain a variety of interactive content including executable codes, videos, and links to external references.  Additionally, the pages of a Jupyter Book can be arranged in any order and placed in a heirarchal, chapter-like structure.
* For classes which have a coding component, the pages which are Jupyter notebooks can be easily downloaded and executed by students locally so that they can practice with the provided code.  It is also possible to enable code to run directly in the Jupyter Books.
* Jupyter Books can easily be turned into website, hosted for free on GitHub.

#### Possible Problems When Using Jupyter Books as Digital Textbooks
* The Jupyter Book software and its prerequisites will need to be installed on a local computer using a terminal and command line arguments, a process which users may not be familar with.
* Editing the pages of a book requires Jupyter (for editing Jupyter notebooks) and a text editor (for the Markdown files) which will also need to be installed if the user does not already use them.  This could add an addtional level of new software.
* For digital textbooks that do not require mathematical equations and coding, there may be simplier methods for creating these resources.

## A Brief Example
The second chapter of this Jupyter Book contains a module I previously developed to introduce neural networks (a method of machine learning) to students in a classical mechanics class (a sophomore level physics class).  I was able to import the module (which contained 1 Markdown file and 3 Jupyter notebooks) as a chapter of this Jupyter notebook with no changes.  This module was imported into this notebook to show the ease of adapting previously existing material for a Jupyter Book and to show how Jupyter Books display mathematical equations and code blocks, along with text.

## Conclusion
Despite the need to learn new softwares to use Jupyter Books, it is an easy to use software for creating digital textbooks, especially in classes that rely heavily on code and mathematical equations.  Much pre-exiting material can be imported with minimal to no changes.  Additionally, since the software is free and hosting the Jupyter Book as a website on GitHub is free, there is no financial cost associated with exploring digital textbooks in your classes with Jupyter Books!
